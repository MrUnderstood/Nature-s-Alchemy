#### **Part 10: Planting in the Garden Sanctuary (3-5 hours)**

- **Objective**: Create a function to allow the user to plant seeds in a garden.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Define the `plant_seed()` function.
    2. Create a list to store the user's garden plants.

##### Step 1: Define the `plant_seed()` function

The `plant_seed()` function will allow the user to plant seeds in their garden. This function will prompt the user to enter the type of seed they want to plant and add it to their garden.

Here's an example implementation of the `plant_seed()` function:

```python
def plant_seed():
    seed = input("Enter the type of seed you want to plant: ")
    garden_plants.append(seed)
    print(f"You have planted {seed} in your garden.")
```

In this example, the user is prompted to enter the type of seed they want to plant using the `input()` function. The entered seed is then added to the `garden_plants` list using the `append()` method. Finally, a confirmation message is printed to inform the user that the seed has been planted.

##### Step 2: Create a list to store the user's garden plants

To keep track of the plants in the user's garden, we will create a list called `garden_plants`. This list will store the names of the plants the user has planted.

Here's an example implementation of the `garden_plants` list:

```python
garden_plants = []
```

You can place this code at the beginning of your script, outside of any functions.

With the `plant_seed()` function and the `garden_plants` list in place, the user will be able to plant seeds in their garden by calling the `plant_seed()` function.

Example usage:

```python
plant_seed()
```

This will prompt the user to enter the type of seed they want to plant, add it to the `garden_plants` list, and print a confirmation message.

Remember to test your code and make any necessary adjustments. Happy coding!
