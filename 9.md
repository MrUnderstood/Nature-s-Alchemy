#### **Part 9: Facing Challenges (3-5 hours)**

- **Objective**: Create a function to introduce challenges to the user.
- **Tasks**:

1. Define the `challenge()` function:

   - Create a new function called `challenge` that takes no arguments.
   - Inside the function, print a message to introduce the challenge to the user.
   - Use the `input()` function to prompt the user for their response to the challenge.
   - Store the user's response in a variable called `user_response`.
   - Return the `user_response` variable.

   ```python
   def challenge():
       print("Welcome to the challenge!")
       user_response = input("Please enter your response: ")
       return user_response
   ```

2. Create different challenges for the user to solve:

   - Call the `challenge()` function multiple times with different challenges.
   - Store the return value of each `challenge()` function call in a variable.
   - Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to evaluate the user's response and provide appropriate feedback.

   ```python
   challenge1 = challenge()
   if challenge1 == "correct":
       print("Congratulations! You solved the first challenge.")
   else:
       print("Sorry, your answer is incorrect.")

   challenge2 = challenge()
   if challenge2 == "correct":
       print("Well done! You solved the second challenge.")
   else:
       print("Oops, your answer is incorrect.")

   # Add more challenges as needed
   ```

   - Repeat this process for each challenge you want to include in your game.
   - Customize the challenges and feedback messages to fit the theme of your game.

Remember to test your code as you go and make any necessary adjustments. Have fun creating challenging scenarios for your players to overcome!
