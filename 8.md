#### **Part 8: Creating Potions (3-5 hours)**
- **Objective**: Create a function to allow the user to make potions.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Define the `create_potion()` function.
    2. Use the user's inventory to create potions.

In this part of the tutorial, we will focus on creating a function that allows the user to make potions in the game. Potions can be a valuable resource for the player and can provide various benefits or abilities. 

##### Task 1: Define the `create_potion()` function.

To start, open your Python script in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and create a new function called `create_potion()`. This function will handle the logic for creating potions. 

```python
def create_potion():
    # Add logic to create potions here
    pass
```

In the above code, we have defined the `create_potion()` function with a `pass` statement. This is a placeholder that does nothing. We will add the logic to create potions in the next task.

##### Task 2: Use the user's inventory to create potions.

To create potions, we will need to use the user's inventory to check if they have the necessary ingredients. We can assume that the user's inventory is stored in a list called `inventory`.

```python
def create_potion():
    # Check if user has necessary ingredients
    if "ingredient1" in inventory and "ingredient2" in inventory:
        # Remove ingredients from inventory
        inventory.remove("ingredient1")
        inventory.remove("ingredient2")
        
        # Add the created potion to the inventory
        inventory.append("potion")
        
        print("You have created a potion!")
    else:
        print("You do not have the necessary ingredients to create a potion.")
```

In the above code, we check if the user has `"ingredient1"` and `"ingredient2"` in their inventory. If they do, we remove these ingredients from the inventory and add the created potion (`"potion"`) to the inventory. If the user does not have the necessary ingredients, we inform them accordingly.

That's it! You have successfully created a function to allow the user to make potions in the game. Feel free to customize the ingredients and potion names based on your game's theme and requirements.

Remember to test your code by calling the `create_potion()` function and checking if the potions are created correctly and the inventory is updated accordingly.

Continue to the next part of the tutorial to learn about introducing challenges to the user in the game.

---

Congratulations on completing Part 8 of the tutorial! In this part, you learned how to create a function to allow the user to make potions in the game. You also learned how to use the user's inventory to check for necessary ingredients and update the inventory accordingly.

Take some time to test your code and make sure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or bugs, don't forget to use print statements to debug your code.

Once you are satisfied with the functionality of the `create_potion()` function, you can move on to Part 9 of the tutorial, where you will learn how to introduce challenges to the user.

Happy coding!
