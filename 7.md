#### **Part 7: Collecting Plants (3-5 hours)**
- **Objective**: Create functions to handle collecting plants.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Define the `collect_plant()` function.
    2. Create a list to store the user's inventory of collected plants.

#### **Step 1: Define the `collect_plant()` function**
To handle collecting plants, we need to define a function called `collect_plant()`. This function will take the name of the plant as an argument and add it to the user's inventory.

Here's an example of how to define the `collect_plant()` function:

```python
def collect_plant(plant_name):
    inventory.append(plant_name)
    print(f"You collected a {plant_name}!")
```

In this example, we assume that you have already created a list called `inventory` to store the user's collected plants. The `append()` method is used to add the `plant_name` to the `inventory` list. We also print a message to let the user know that they have collected a plant.

#### **Step 2: Create a list to store the user's inventory of collected plants**
Before we can start collecting plants, we need to create a list to store the user's inventory. This list will keep track of all the plants the user has collected.

Here's an example of how to create the `inventory` list:

```python
inventory = []
```

You can add this line of code at the beginning of your script or in a specific section where you handle the user's inventory.

With the `collect_plant()` function and the `inventory` list in place, you can now call the `collect_plant()` function whenever the user collects a plant in your game.

Example usage:

```python
# Assume the user collected a plant called "Rose"
collect_plant("Rose")
```

This will add "Rose" to the `inventory` list and print the message "You collected a Rose!".

Remember to test your code and make any necessary adjustments to ensure it works correctly.
