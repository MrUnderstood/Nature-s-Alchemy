## Part 5: Creating the Main Game Loop (2-3 hours)

### Objective: 
Set up the main game loop where the game actions will take place.

### Tasks:
1. Define the `main()` function.
2. Create a while loop to keep the game running until the user decides to quit.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC) and open the file where you have been writing your Python code.

2. At the end of your code, create a new line and define the `main()` function. This function will serve as the main entry point for your game.

   ```python
   def main():
       # Code for the game actions will go here
       pass
   ```

3. Inside the `main()` function, create a `while` loop that will keep the game running until the user decides to quit. You can use a variable called `running` to control the loop.

   ```python
   def main():
       running = True
       while running:
           # Code for the game actions will go here
           pass
   ```

4. Now, you can start adding the game actions inside the `while` loop. For example, you can prompt the user for input and perform actions based on their choices.

   ```python
   def main():
       running = True
       while running:
           user_input = input("What do you want to do? (Type 'quit' to exit): ")
           
           if user_input == "quit":
               running = False
           else:
               # Perform actions based on user input
               pass
   ```

5. Fill in the `else` block with the specific actions you want the game to perform based on the user's input. You can call other functions, modify variables, or display messages to the user.

   ```python
   def main():
       running = True
       while running:
           user_input = input("What do you want to do? (Type 'quit' to exit): ")
           
           if user_input == "quit":
               running = False
           else:
               # Perform actions based on user input
               if user_input == "explore":
                   explore_biome()
               elif user_input == "collect":
                   collect_plant()
               else:
                   print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
   ```

6. Continue adding more game actions and conditions inside the `while` loop as needed for your game.

7. Save your code and run the script. The game loop will keep running until the user types "quit" to exit.

Congratulations! You have successfully created the main game loop for your text-based game. Now you can continue building upon this foundation and add more features and functionalities to make your game more interactive and engaging.
