# Part 3: Understanding Basic Python Syntax

### Objective: Learn about variables, data types, and basic control structures

### Tasks

#### 1. Follow a basic Python tutorial to understand variables, data types, loops, and conditionals

##### 1.1 Variables

Variables in Python are like containers where we can store different types of data. To create a variable, you need to give it a name and assign it a value using the equals sign (`=`).

Let's create a variable named `my_name` and assign it the value `"Alice"`:

```python
my_name = "Alice"
```

We can print the value of a variable using the `print()` function:

```python
print(my_name)
```

##### 1.2 Data Types

Python has several different data types. The most common ones you'll use are:

- **Strings** (`str`): These are sequences of characters and are defined by enclosing characters in quotes. Example: `"Hello, World!"`

- **Integers** (`int`): These are whole numbers. Example: `10`

- **Floats** (`float`): These are decimal numbers. Example: `3.14`

- **Booleans** (`bool`): These are truth values and can be either `True` or `False`.

##### 1.3 Loops

Loops are a way to repeatedly execute some code. Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints the numbers 1 through 5:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

##### 1.4 Conditionals

Conditionals are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The `if` statement is used for this.

Here's an example that prints out "Good job!" if the variable `score` is over 80:

```python
score = 85

if score > 80:
    print("Good job!")
```

##### Practice

Now that you've learned these basic concepts, try to create your own variables, use different data types, write a loop, and make a conditional statement. Remember, practice is key in learning programming!
