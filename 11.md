#### **Part 11: Learning About Plants (3-5 hours)**
- **Objective**: Create a function to provide information about different plants.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Define the `learn_about_plant()` function.
    2. Create a dictionary to store information about different plants.

In this part of the tutorial, we will focus on creating a function that provides information about different plants in the game. This will enhance the user's knowledge about the virtual world they are exploring.

##### Task 1: Define the `learn_about_plant()` function
To get started, we need to define a function called `learn_about_plant()` that will display information about a specific plant. This function will take the name of the plant as an argument.

Here is an example of how the function can be defined:

```python
def learn_about_plant(plant_name):
    plant_info = plant_dictionary.get(plant_name)
    if plant_info:
        print(f"Information about {plant_name}:")
        print(f"Description: {plant_info['description']}")
        print(f"Uses: {plant_info['uses']}")
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, {plant_name} is not in the database.")
```

In this example, we assume that you have already created a dictionary called `plant_dictionary` that stores information about different plants. The dictionary should have the plant names as keys and a dictionary of information as values. The information dictionary should contain keys like 'description' and 'uses' to provide details about the plant.

##### Task 2: Create a dictionary to store information about different plants
To provide information about different plants, we need to create a dictionary that stores the details. Each plant will be represented by a key-value pair in the dictionary.

Here is an example of how the dictionary can be created:

```python
plant_dictionary = {
    "Rose": {
        "description": "A beautiful flower with thorns.",
        "uses": "Used in perfumes and as a symbol of love."
    },
    "Lavender": {
        "description": "A fragrant purple flower.",
        "uses": "Used in aromatherapy and as a natural remedy for relaxation."
    },
    "Sunflower": {
        "description": "A tall flower that follows the sun.",
        "uses": "Seeds are edible and oil is extracted for various purposes."
    }
}
```

In this example, we have added three plants to the dictionary with their respective descriptions and uses. You can add more plants and their information as per your game's requirements.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed Part 11 of the tutorial. By creating the `learn_about_plant()` function and the plant dictionary, you can now provide information about different plants in your game. Feel free to customize the function and dictionary to suit your game's needs. Keep up the good work!

Next, move on to Part 12: Testing and Debugging to learn how to test, debug, and improve your game.
