# Part 2: Your First Python Script

### Objective: Write a simple Python script to understand the basics

### Tasks

#### 1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC) and create a new file named hello.py

1.1. Start Visual Studio Code.

- On Windows, you can find it in the Start Menu.
- On Mac, you can find it in the Launchpad.
- On Linux, it depends on your distribution, but it's usually found in the applications menu.

1.2. Once Visual Studio Code is open, click on `File` in the menu at the top, then click on `New File`.

1.3. Now you should see an empty file. To save it, click on `File` again, then `Save As`.

1.4. A dialog will open asking you where to save the file and what to name it.

- Choose a location that you will remember (like your Documents folder).
- In the `File name` box, type `hello.py`. Make sure you include the `.py` at the end. This tells your computer that it's a Python file.

#### 2. Write print("Hello, World!") in hello.py and run the script

2.1. Now that you have your `hello.py` file, it's time to write some Python code.

2.2. In the empty file, type the following:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print` is a function in Python that writes whatever is inside the parentheses to the console.
- The `"Hello, World!"` part is a string of text (or 'string' for short). Strings in Python are written between quotation marks.

2.3. Now save your file by clicking `File` then `Save` (or you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+S` on Windows or `Command+S` on Mac).

2.4. To run your Python script, you'll need to open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

- You can do this by clicking on `Terminal` in the menu at the top, then `New Terminal`.
- This will open a terminal at the bottom of the window.

2.5. In the terminal, you need to tell Python to run your script.

- Type `python hello.py` and press `Enter`.
- You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal. That's the output of your Python script!

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first Python script. This is a big step in learning Python. Be sure to take a break and celebrate before moving on to the next part of the tutorial.
