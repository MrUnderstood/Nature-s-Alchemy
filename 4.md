#### **Part 4: Functions and User Input (3-4 hours)**

- **Objective**: Learn how to define functions and get user input.
- **Tasks**:
    1. Open VSC and create a new file named `functions_user_input.py`.
    2. Define a function called `greet_user()` that takes no arguments and prints a greeting message. For example:
        ```python
        def greet_user():
            print("Welcome to Nature's Alchemy!")
        ```
    3. Call the `greet_user()` function to test if the greeting message is displayed.
    4. Modify the `greet_user()` function to take a parameter called `name` and print a personalized greeting message. For example:
        ```python
        def greet_user(name):
            print("Welcome to Nature's Alchemy, " + name + "!")
        ```
    5. Use the `input()` function to get the user's name and store it in a variable called `user_name`. For example:
        ```python
        user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
        ```
    6. Call the `greet_user()` function with the `user_name` variable as an argument.
    7. Run the script and check if the personalized greeting message is displayed.
    8. Define a function called `get_user_age()` that takes no arguments and prompts the user to enter their age. For example:
        ```python
        def get_user_age():
            age = input("Please enter your age: ")
            return int(age)
        ```
    9. Call the `get_user_age()` function and store the returned value in a variable called `user_age`.
    10. Print the user's age by using the `user_age` variable.
    11. Run the script and verify if the user is prompted to enter their age and the age is correctly stored and displayed.

By following these steps, you will learn how to define functions, get user input, and use the input values in your program. This will be useful for creating interactive features in your game.
