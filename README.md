## Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

**Objective**: Install necessary tools and setup the development environment.

**Tasks**:
1. Download and install Python from python.org.
2. Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSC) from Visual Studio Code.

Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

## Part 2: Your First Python Script

**Objective**: Write a simple Python script to understand the basics.

**Tasks**:
1. Open VSC and create a new file named hello.py.
2. Write `print("Hello, World!")` in hello.py and run the script.

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Part 3: Understanding Basic Python Syntax

**Objective**: Learn about variables, data types, and basic control structures.

**Tasks**:
1. Follow a basic Python tutorial to understand variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.

Estimated Time: 4-6 hours

## Part 4: Functions and User Input

**Objective**: Learn how to define functions and get user input.

**Tasks**:
1. Define a function to greet the user.
2. Use the `input()` function to get the user's name and greet them.

Estimated Time: 3-4 hours

## Part 5: Creating the Main Game Loop

**Objective**: Set up the main game loop where the game actions will take place.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `main()` function.
2. Create a while loop to keep the game running until the user decides to quit.

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Part 6: Exploring Biomes

**Objective**: Create a function to allow the user to explore different biomes.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `explore_biome()` function.
2. Create a dictionary to store descriptions of different biomes.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 7: Collecting Plants

**Objective**: Create functions to handle collecting plants.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `collect_plant()` function.
2. Create a list to store the user's inventory of collected plants.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 8: Creating Potions

**Objective**: Create a function to allow the user to make potions.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `create_potion()` function.
2. Use the user's inventory to create potions.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 9: Facing Challenges

**Objective**: Create a function to introduce challenges to the user.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `challenge()` function.
2. Create different challenges for the user to solve.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 10: Planting in the Garden Sanctuary

**Objective**: Create a function to allow the user to plant seeds in a garden.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `plant_seed()` function.
2. Create a list to store the user's garden plants.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 11: Learning About Plants

**Objective**: Create a function to provide information about different plants.

**Tasks**:
1. Define the `learn_about_plant()` function.
2. Create a dictionary to store information about different plants.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

## Part 12: Testing and Debugging

**Objective**: Learn how to test, debug, and improve your game.

**Tasks**:
1. Play through your game, identifying any bugs or issues.
2. Use print statements to debug your code.

Estimated Time: 4-6 hours

## Part 13: Sharing Your Game

**Objective**: Share your game with friends and family.

**Tasks**:
1. Show your game to friends and family, and gather their feedback.
2. Make any final improvements to your game based on feedback.

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Part 14: Reflection and Next Steps

**Objective**: Reflect on what you've learned and plan your next project.

**Tasks**:
1. Write down what you learned from building "Nature's Alchemy".
2. Think about what you want to learn next and start planning your next project.

Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
